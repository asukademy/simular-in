# What is Windwalker

![logo](../media/images/logo/windwalker-logo.png)

## Windwalker is A Modern PHP framework

Windwalker is a modern PHP framework to simplify web application developments.
We are trying to create a lightweight, easy using and fully decoupled PHP framework, 
you may start using Windwalker and learning it very fast.

Windwalker is also very strong and flexible, the [package system](../documentation/start/package-system.html) help us building
complex enterprise level applications.

It is based on [Joomla Framework](http://framework.joomla.org). We referenced the main structure of Joomla but 
rewrote almost 80% codes, and added some new packages. The starter application also referenced many well-known frameworks 
like: Laravel, Symfony and Rails.

# History

For a long time, we are worked on Joomla CMS as a main environment and we are also Joomla contributors.
Then we created our RAD framework: [Windwalker Joomla RAD](http://rad.windwalker.io) to enhance the speed of
 development.

There are many and many new ideas and technologies we have developed in our internal framework, and we met the bottleneck on using 
Joomla's structure, so we decided to create a new framework based on Joomla, but mix our technologies and experiences. That is why we 
 created Windwalker.
 
# Why A New Framework?

Before start writing Windwalker, we survey many frameworks, Symfony is too heavy for us, and Laravel is not as flexible as what we want,
 after months thinking, we decided to create a framework to fill the missing position between Symfony and Laravel. There are something 
 we can do better than others, we don't want to lose it. 

We know PHP developers has already sick of too many frameworks in this world, so we don't change too much thing. We try to make
some architecture similar to current frameworks and common PHP practices, and make the interface VERY VERY simple to understand.
We hope Windwalker will not bring too much pain on learning it. If you don't want to use Windwalker framework, 
but there is useful package which you are interested, you may install and use it easily. 

# RAD Framework

Windwalker Joomla RAD (Rapid Application Framework) is our main feature, it contains many useful tools like assets manager,
code generator, database sync and a powerful admin UI interface, but it has not implemented yet in Windwalker PHP framework.
All those features will be moved to Windwalker after version 2.1 which Windwalker may reach stable.

# Credits

Windwalker incorporated many ideas and work from other well-known Web frameworks. Below is a short list of those Windwalker inspired by.

- [Joomla](http://joomla.org) - Most Windwalker packages are based or highly influenced by Joomla.
- [Laravel](http://laravel.com) - Windwalker referenced the Facades pattern from Laravel.
- [Symfony](http://laravel.com) - Windwalker referenced its bundle and console design.
- [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/) - The Database Command is referenced from Yii.

In addition, there are many other projects inspired us, and we'll continue contribute back to Joomla. Thank you, opensource.
